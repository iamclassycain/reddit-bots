My reddit bot is supporting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris while opposing Donald Trump and anyone affiliated with the Republican Party, including Mitch McConnel and Mike Pence.

#### GRADE: 21/20
I successfully completed tasks 0-5, generated 500 valid comments, and produced the the github repository. For extra credit, I pulled 20 submissions from an external subredit and posted them into the csc040temp subreddit. I also included code to make my bot upvote comments and submissions that mentioned my favorite candidates.
